Developing Data Products-Leaflet - Assignment

My First Map

Create a map that shows the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai Tamilnadu India.

To do that, letâ€™s first load the library Leaflet.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

Create the map

```{r}
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles()
my_map
```

Create a link to the office site of  Meenakshi Temple in Madurai India , which we could get relevant information.

```{r}
temple <- c("<a href= 'http://maduraimeenakshitemple.com/' >Meenakshi Temple</a>")
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=9.9195098, lng=78.1171531, popup = temple)
```
